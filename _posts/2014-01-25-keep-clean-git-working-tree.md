      I am really lazy and my git repositories tend to be messy. I sometimes write useful scripts but I don&#8217;t commit it nor remove it from project directories. So, my <code>git status</code> tends to output a lot of &#8220;untracked&#8221; files.
    </p>

    <p>
      One day, I pushed commits without adding necessary files. This caused some time loss on my team. I hate wasting time, regardless of mine or of others. So I determined to keep my git repositories clean to prevent this from happening again.

    Using git pre-push hook
  </h2>

  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
    <p>
      I wrote a git pre-push hook which prevents me from pushing when my repository is dirty. This way, I cannot push commits if any untracked files exist, and I will not likely to push flawed commits again. You can use this too by saving the script below as <code>.git/hooks/pre-push</code> in your repositories (make sure you make it executable).

        However, I still sometimes want to keep temporary files in my repository, but don&#8217;t want to commit those. To manage this situation, I found <code>.git/info/exclude</code> file useful. It is <code>.gitignore</code> you don&#8217;t have to commit. So, you can ignore files only in your repositories.
      </p>

      <p>
        I made a directory named &#8220;stash&#8221; in my repository and ran <code>echo 'stash' &gt;&gt; .git/info/exclude</code>. Now I can keep my crappy scripts in the &#8220;stash&#8221; directory without being committed nor being listed as &#8220;untracked&#8221;.

      <p>
        If you think you will use <code>.git/info/exclude</code> a lot, following script might be useful. After saving it as &#8220;git-exclude&#8221; and making it executable, you can issue <code>git exclude 'file'â€‹</code> to add files to <code>.git/info/exclude</code>.

          You might want to manage git hooks the nicer way if you want to use multiple hooks. I found <a href="https://github.com/icefox/git-hooks" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://github.com']);">icefox/git-hooks</a> and it seems promising. The great thing about it is that it allows me to have &#8220;User hooks&#8221; in <code>~/.git_hooks</code>. So, now I can manage my git hooks effortlessly in my dotfiles repository.
